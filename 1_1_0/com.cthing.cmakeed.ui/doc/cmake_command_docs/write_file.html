    <pre>  write_file(filename "message to write"... [APPEND])<br></pre>
    <p>The first argument is the file name, the rest of the arguments are messages to write. If the argument APPEND is specified, then the message will be appended.<br><p>NOTE 1: file(WRITE ... and file(APPEND ... do exactly the same as this one but add some more functionality.<br><p>NOTE 2: When using write_file the produced file cannot be used as an input to CMake (CONFIGURE_FILE, source file ...) because it will lead to an infinite loop. Use configure_file if you want to generate input files to CMake.

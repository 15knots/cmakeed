    <p>Locate gdal<br><p>This module accepts the following environment variables:<br><pre>    GDAL_DIR or GDAL_ROOT - Specify the location of GDAL<br></pre>
    <p><br><p>This module defines the following CMake variables:<br><pre>    GDAL_FOUND - True if libgdal is found<br>    GDAL_LIBRARY - A variable pointing to the GDAL library<br>    GDAL_INCLUDE_DIR - Where to find the headers<br></pre>
    <p><br><p>$GDALDIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$GDAL_DIR used in building gdal.<br><p>Created by Eric Wing. I'm not a gdal user, but OpenSceneGraph uses it  for osgTerrain so I whipped this module together for completeness. I actually don't know the conventions or where files are typically placed in distros. Any real gdal users are encouraged to correct this (but please don't break the OS X framework stuff when doing so which is what usually seems  to happen).

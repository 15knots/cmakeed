    <a name="single_item:FindBoost"><b><code>FindBoost</code></b></a>: Try to find Boost include dirs and libraries<br>
    <p>Usage of this module as follows:<br><p>== Using Header-Only libraries from within Boost: ==<br><pre>   find_package( Boost 1.36.0 )<br>   if(Boost_FOUND)<br>      include_directories(${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS})<br>      add_executable(foo foo.cc)<br>   endif()<br></pre>
    <p><br><p><br><p>== Using actual libraries from within Boost: ==<br><pre>   set(Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS   ON)<br>   set(Boost_USE_MULTITHREADED ON)<br>   find_package( Boost 1.36.0 COMPONENTS date_time filesystem system ... )<br></pre>
    <p><br><pre>   if(Boost_FOUND)<br>      include_directories(${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS})<br>      add_executable(foo foo.cc)<br>      target_link_libraries(foo ${Boost_LIBRARIES})<br>   endif()<br></pre>
    <p><br><p><br><p>The components list needs to contain actual names of boost libraries only, such as "date_time" for "libboost_date_time".  If you're using parts of Boost that contain header files only (e.g. foreach) you do not need to specify COMPONENTS.<br><p>You should provide a minimum version number that should be used. If you provide this  version number and specify the REQUIRED attribute, this module will fail if it can't find the specified or a later version. If you specify a version number this is automatically put into the considered list of version numbers and thus doesn't need to be specified in the Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS variable (see below).<br><p>NOTE for Visual Studio Users:<br><pre>     Automatic linking is used on MSVC &amp; Borland compilers by default when<br>     #including things in Boost.  It's important to note that setting<br>     Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS to OFF is NOT enough to get you dynamic linking,<br>     should you need this feature.  Automatic linking typically uses static<br>     libraries with a few exceptions (Boost.Python is one).<br></pre>
    <p><br><pre>     Please see the section below near Boost_LIB_DIAGNOSTIC_DEFINITIONS for<br>     more details.  Adding a TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES() as shown in the example<br>     above appears to cause VS to link dynamically if Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS<br>     gets set to OFF.  It is suggested you avoid automatic linking since it<br>     will make your application less portable.<br></pre>
    <p><br><p>=========== The mess that is Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS (sorry?) ============<br><p>OK, so the Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS variable can be used to specify a list of boost version numbers that should be taken into account when searching for Boost. Unfortunately boost puts the version number into the actual filename for the libraries, so this variable will certainly be needed in the future when new Boost versions are released.<br><p>Currently this module searches for the following version numbers: 1.33, 1.33.0, 1.33.1, 1.34, 1.34.0, 1.34.1, 1.35, 1.35.0, 1.35.1, 1.36, 1.36.0, 1.36.1, 1.37, 1.37.0, 1.38, 1.38.0<br><p>NOTE: If you add a new major 1.x version in Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS you should add both 1.x and 1.x.0 as shown above.  Official Boost include directories omit the 3rd version number from include paths if it is 0 although not all binary Boost releases do so.<br><p>SET(Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS "0.99" "0.99.0" "1.78" "1.78.0")<br><p>============================================================================<br><p>Variables used by this module, they can change the default behaviour and need to be set before calling find_package:<br><pre>   Boost_USE_MULTITHREADED      Can be set to OFF to use the non-multithreaded<br>                                boost libraries.  If not specified, defaults<br>                                to ON.<br></pre>
    <p><br><pre>   Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS        Can be set to ON to force the use of the static<br>                                boost libraries. Defaults to OFF.<br></pre>
    <p><br><p>Other Variables used by this module which you may want to set.<br><pre>   Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS    A list of version numbers to use for searching<br>                                the boost include directory.  Please see<br>                                the documentation above regarding this<br>                                annoying, but necessary variable :(<br></pre>
    <p><br><pre>   Boost_DEBUG                  Set this to TRUE to enable debugging output<br>                                of FindBoost.cmake if you are having problems.<br>                                Please enable this before filing any bug<br>                                reports.<br></pre>
    <p><br><pre>   Boost_COMPILER               Set this to the compiler suffix used by Boost<br>                                (e.g. "-gcc43") if FindBoost has problems finding<br>                                the proper Boost installation<br></pre>
    <p><br><p>These last three variables are available also as environment variables:<br><pre>   BOOST_ROOT or BOOSTROOT      The preferred installation prefix for searching for<br>                                Boost.  Set this if the module has problems finding<br>                                the proper Boost installation.<br></pre>
    <p><br><pre>   BOOST_INCLUDEDIR             Set this to the include directory of Boost, if the<br>                                module has problems finding the proper Boost installation<br></pre>
    <p><br><pre>   BOOST_LIBRARYDIR             Set this to the lib directory of Boost, if the<br>                                module has problems finding the proper Boost installation<br></pre>
    <p><br><p>Variables defined by this module:<br><pre>   Boost_FOUND                         System has Boost, this means the include dir was<br>                                       found, as well as all the libraries specified in<br>                                       the COMPONENTS list.<br></pre>
    <p><br><pre>   Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS                  Boost include directories: not cached<br></pre>
    <p><br><pre>   Boost_INCLUDE_DIR                   This is almost the same as above, but this one is<br>                                       cached and may be modified by advanced users<br></pre>
    <p><br><pre>   Boost_LIBRARIES                     Link to these to use the Boost libraries that you<br>                                       specified: not cached<br></pre>
    <p><br><pre>   Boost_LIBRARY_DIRS                  The path to where the Boost library files are.<br></pre>
    <p><br><pre>   Boost_VERSION                       The version number of the boost libraries that<br>                                       have been found, same as in version.hpp from Boost<br></pre>
    <p><br><pre>   Boost_LIB_VERSION                   The version number in filename form as<br>                                       it's appended to the library filenames<br></pre>
    <p><br><pre>   Boost_MAJOR_VERSION                 major version number of boost<br>   Boost_MINOR_VERSION                 minor version number of boost<br>   Boost_SUBMINOR_VERSION              subminor version number of boost<br></pre>
    <p><br><pre>   Boost_LIB_DIAGNOSTIC_DEFINITIONS    [WIN32 Only] You can call<br>                                       add_definitions(${Boost_LIB_DIAGNOSTIC_DEFINTIIONS})<br>                                       to have diagnostic information about Boost's<br>                                       automatic linking outputted during compilation time.<br></pre>
    <p><br><p>For each component you specify in find_package(), the following (UPPER-CASE) variables are set.  You can use these variables if you would like to pick and choose components for your targets instead of just using Boost_LIBRARIES.<br><pre>   Boost_${COMPONENT}_FOUND            True IF the Boost library "component" was found.<br></pre>
    <p><br><pre>   Boost_${COMPONENT}_LIBRARY          Contains the libraries for the specified Boost<br>                                       "component" (includes debug and optimized keywords<br>                                       when needed).<br></pre>

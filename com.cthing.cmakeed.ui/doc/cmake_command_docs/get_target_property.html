    <a name="single_item:get_target_property"><b><code>get_target_property</code></b></a>: Get a property from a target.<br>
    <pre>  get_target_property(VAR target property)<br></pre>
    <p>Get a property from a target.   The value of the property is stored in the variable VAR.  If the property is not found, VAR will be set to "NOTFOUND".  Use set_target_properties to set property values.  Properties are usually used to control how a target is built.<br><p>The read-only property "&lt;CONFIG&gt;_LOCATION" provides the full path to the file on disk that will be created for the target when building under configuration &lt;CONFIG&gt; (in upper-case, such as "DEBUG_LOCATION"). The read-only property "LOCATION" specifies the full path to the file on disk that will be created for the target. The path may contain a build-system-specific portion that is replaced at build time with the configuration getting built (such as "$(ConfigurationName)" in VS). This is very useful for executable targets to get the path to the executable file for use in a custom command.<br><p>The read-only property "TYPE" returns which type the specified target has (EXECUTABLE, STATIC_LIBRARY, SHARED_LIBRARY, MODULE_LIBRARY, UTILITY, INSTALL_FILES or INSTALL_PROGRAMS). This command can get properties for any target so far created. The targets do not need to be in the current CMakeLists.txt file.

    <a name="single_item:export"><b><code>export</code></b></a>: Export targets from the build tree for use by outside projects.<br />
    <pre>  export(TARGETS [target1 [target2 [...]]] [NAMESPACE &lt;namespace&gt;]<br />         [APPEND] FILE &lt;filename&gt;)<br /></pre>
    <p>Create a file &lt;filename&gt; that may be included by outside projects to import targets from the current project's build tree.  This is useful during cross-compiling to build utility executables that can run on the host platform in one project and then import them into another project being compiled for the target platform.  If the NAMESPACE option is given the &lt;namespace&gt; string will be prepended to all target names written to the file.  If the APPEND option is given the generated code will be appended to the file instead of overwriting it.  If a library target is included in the export but a target to which it links is not included the behavior is unspecified.<br /></p>
<p>The file created by this command is specific to the build tree and should never be installed.  See the install(EXPORT) command to export targets from an installation tree.<br /></p>
<pre>  export(PACKAGE &lt;name&gt;)<br /></pre>
    <p>Store the current build directory in the CMake user package registry for package &lt;name&gt;.  The find_package command may consider the directory while searching for package &lt;name&gt;.  This helps dependent projects find and use a package from the current project's build tree without help from the user.  Note that the entry in the package registry that this command creates works only in conjunction with a package configuration file (&lt;name&gt;Config.cmake) that works with the build tree.</p>

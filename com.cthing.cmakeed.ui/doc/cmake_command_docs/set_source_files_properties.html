    <p>Set properties on a file. The syntax for the command is to list all the files you want to change, and then provide the values you want to set next.  You can make up your own properties as well.  The following are used by CMake.  The ABSTRACT flag (boolean) is used by some class wrapping commands. If WRAP_EXCLUDE (boolean) is true then many wrapping commands will ignore this file. If GENERATED (boolean) is true then it is not an error if this source file does not exist when it is added to a target.  Obviously, it must be created (presumably by a custom command) before the target is built.  If the HEADER_FILE_ONLY (boolean) property is true then the file is not compiled.  This is useful if you want to add extra non build files to an IDE. OBJECT_DEPENDS (string) adds dependencies to the object file.  COMPILE_FLAGS (string) is passed to the compiler as additional command line arguments when the source file is compiled.  LANGUAGE (string) CXX|C will change the default compiler used to compile the source file. The languages used need to be enabled in the PROJECT command. If SYMBOLIC (boolean) is set to true the build system will be informed that the source file is not actually created on disk but instead used as a symbolic name for a build rule.

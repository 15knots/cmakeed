    <p>Specify a list of libraries to be linked into the specified target.  If any library name matches that of a target in the current project a dependency will automatically be added in the build system to make sure the library being linked is up-to-date before the target links.<br><p>A "debug", "optimized", or "general" keyword indicates that the library immediately following it is to be used only for the corresponding build configuration.  The "debug" keyword corresponds to the Debug configuration (or to configurations named in the DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS global property if it is set).  The "optimized" keyword corresponds to all other configurations.  The "general" keyword corresponds to all configurations, and is purely optional (assumed if omitted).  Higher granularity may be achieved for per-configuration rules by creating and linking to IMPORTED library targets.  See the IMPORTED mode of the add_library command for more information.  <br><p>Library dependencies are transitive by default.  When this target is linked into another target then the libraries linked to this target will appear on the link line for the other target too.  See the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES target property to override the set of transitive link dependencies for a target.<br><pre>  target_link_libraries(&lt;target&gt; LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES<br>                        [[debug|optimized|general] &lt;lib&gt;] ...)<br></pre>
    <p>The LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES mode appends the libraries to the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES and its per-configuration equivalent target properties instead of using them for linking.  Libraries specified as "debug" are appended to the the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_DEBUG property (or to the properties corresponding to configurations listed in the DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS global property if it is set).  Libraries specified as "optimized" are appended to the the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES property.  Libraries specified as "general" (or without any keyword) are treated as if specified for both "debug" and "optimized".

    <a name="single_item:if"><b><code>if</code></b></a>: Conditionally execute a group of commands.<br>
    <pre>  if(expression)<br>    # then section.<br>    COMMAND1(ARGS ...)<br>    COMMAND2(ARGS ...)<br>    ...<br>  elseif(expression2)<br>    # elseif section.<br>    COMMAND1(ARGS ...)<br>    COMMAND2(ARGS ...)<br>    ...<br>  else(expression)<br>    # else section.<br>    COMMAND1(ARGS ...)<br>    COMMAND2(ARGS ...)<br>    ...<br>  endif(expression)<br></pre>
    <p>Evaluates the given expression.  If the result is true, the commands in the THEN section are invoked.  Otherwise, the commands in the else section are invoked.  The elseif and else sections are optional. You may have multiple elseif clauses. Note that the expression in the else and endif clause is optional. Long expressions can be used and there is a traditional order of precedence. Parenthetical expressions are evaluated first followed by unary operators such as EXISTS, COMMAND, and DEFINED. Then any EQUAL, LESS, GREATER, STRLESS, STRGREATER, STREQUAL, MATCHES will be evaluated. Then NOT operators and finally AND, OR operators will be evaluated. Possible expressions are:<br><pre>  if(&lt;constant&gt;)<br></pre>
    <p>True if the constant is 1, ON, YES, TRUE, Y, or a non-zero number.  False if the constant is 0, OFF, NO, FALSE, N, IGNORE, "", or ends in the suffix '-NOTFOUND'.  Named boolean constants are case-insensitive.<br><pre>  if(&lt;variable&gt;)<br></pre>
    <p>True if the variable's value is not a false constant.<br><pre>  if(NOT &lt;expression&gt;)<br></pre>
    <p>True if the expression is not true.<br><pre>  if(&lt;expr1&gt; AND &lt;expr2&gt;)<br></pre>
    <p>True if both expressions would be considered true individually.<br><pre>  if(&lt;expr1&gt; OR &lt;expr2&gt;)<br></pre>
    <p>True if either expression would be considered true individually.<br><pre>  if(COMMAND command-name)<br></pre>
    <p>True if the given name is a command, macro or function that can be invoked.<br><pre>  if(POLICY policy-id)<br></pre>
    <p>True if the given name is an existing policy (of the form CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;).<br><pre>  if(TARGET target-name)<br></pre>
    <p>True if the given name is an existing target, built or imported.<br><pre>  if(EXISTS file-name)<br>  if(EXISTS directory-name)<br></pre>
    <p>True if the named file or directory exists.  Behavior is well-defined only for full paths.<br><pre>  if(file1 IS_NEWER_THAN file2)<br></pre>
    <p>True if file1 is newer than file2 or if one of the two files doesn't exist. Behavior is well-defined only for full paths.<br><pre>  if(IS_DIRECTORY directory-name)<br></pre>
    <p>True if the given name is a directory.  Behavior is well-defined only for full paths.<br><pre>  if(IS_ABSOLUTE path)<br></pre>
    <p>True if the given path is an absolute path.<br><pre>  if(variable MATCHES regex)<br>  if(string MATCHES regex)<br></pre>
    <p>True if the given string or variable's value matches the given regular expression.<br><pre>  if(variable LESS number)<br>  if(string LESS number)<br>  if(variable GREATER number)<br>  if(string GREATER number)<br>  if(variable EQUAL number)<br>  if(string EQUAL number)<br></pre>
    <p>True if the given string or variable's value is a valid number and the inequality or equality is true.<br><pre>  if(variable STRLESS string)<br>  if(string STRLESS string)<br>  if(variable STRGREATER string)<br>  if(string STRGREATER string)<br>  if(variable STREQUAL string)<br>  if(string STREQUAL string)<br></pre>
    <p>True if the given string or variable's value is lexicographically less (or greater, or equal) than the string or variable on the right.<br><pre>  if(version1 VERSION_LESS version2)<br>  if(version1 VERSION_EQUAL version2)<br>  if(version1 VERSION_GREATER version2)<br></pre>
    <p>Component-wise integer version number comparison (version format is major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]).<br><pre>  if(DEFINED variable)<br></pre>
    <p>True if the given variable is defined. It does not matter if the variable is true or false just if it has been set.<br><pre>  if((expression) AND (expression OR (expression)))<br></pre>
    <p>The expressions inside the parenthesis are evaluated first and then the remaining expression is evaluated as in the previous examples. Where there are nested parenthesis the innermost are evaluated as part of evaluating the expression that contains them.<br><p>The if statement was written fairly early in CMake's history and it has some convenience features that are worth covering. The if statement reduces operations until there is a single remaining value, at that point if the case insensitive value is: ON, 1, YES, TRUE, Y it returns true, if it is OFF, 0, NO, FALSE, N, NOTFOUND, *-NOTFOUND, IGNORE it will return false. <br><p>This is fairly reasonable. The convenience feature that sometimes throws new authors is how CMake handles values that do not match the true or false list. Those values are treated as variables and are dereferenced even though they do not have the required ${} syntax. This means that if you write<br><pre>  if (boobah)<br></pre>
    <p>CMake will treat it as if you wrote <br><pre>  if (${boobah})<br></pre>
    <p>likewise if you write <br><pre>  if (fubar AND sol)<br></pre>
    <p>CMake will conveniently treat it as <br><pre>  if ("${fubar}" AND "${sol}")<br></pre>
    <p>The later is really the correct way to write it, but the former will work as well. Only some operations in the if statement have this special handling of arguments. The specific details follow: <br><p>1) The left hand argument to MATCHES is first checked to see if it is a defined variable, if so the variable's value is used, otherwise the original value is used. <br><p>2) If the left hand argument to MATCHES is missing it returns false without error <br><p>3) Both left and right hand arguments to LESS GREATER EQUAL are independently tested to see if they are defined variables, if so their defined values are used otherwise the original value is used. <br><p>4) Both left and right hand arguments to STRLESS STREQUAL STRGREATER are independently tested to see if they are defined variables, if so their defined values are used otherwise the original value is used. <br><p>5) Both left and right hand argumemnts to VERSION_LESS VERSION_EQUAL VERSION_GREATER are independently tested to see if they are defined variables, if so their defined values are used otherwise the original value is used. <br><p>6) The right hand argument to NOT is tested to see if it is a boolean constant, if so the value is used, otherwise it is assumed to be a variable and it is dereferenced. <br><p>7) The left and right hand arguments to AND OR are independently tested to see if they are boolean constants, if so they are used as such, otherwise they are assumed to be variables and are dereferenced. <br>

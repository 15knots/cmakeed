    <a name="single_item:add_executable"><b><code>add_executable</code></b></a>: Add an executable to the project using the specified source files.<br>
    <pre>  add_executable(&lt;name&gt; [WIN32] [MACOSX_BUNDLE] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL]<br>                 source1 source2 ... sourceN)<br></pre>
    <p>Adds an executable target called &lt;name&gt; to be built from the source files listed in the command invocation.  The &lt;name&gt; corresponds to the logical target name and must be globally unique within a project.  The actual file name of the executable built is constructed based on conventions of the native platform (such as &lt;name&gt;.exe or just &lt;name&gt;).  <br><p>By default the executable file will be created in the build tree directory corresponding to the source tree directory in which the command was invoked.  See documentation of the RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY target property to change this location.  See documentation of the OUTPUT_NAME target property to change the &lt;name&gt; part of the final file name.  <br><p>If WIN32 is given the property WIN32_EXECUTABLE will be set on the target created.  See documentation of that target property for details.<br><p>If MACOSX_BUNDLE is given the corresponding property will be set on the created target.  See documentation of the MACOSX_BUNDLE target property for details.<br><p>If EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL is given the corresponding property will be set on the created target.  See documentation of the EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL target property for details.<br><p>The add_executable command can also create IMPORTED executable targets using this signature:<br><pre>  add_executable(&lt;name&gt; IMPORTED)<br></pre>
    <p>An IMPORTED executable target references an executable file located outside the project.  No rules are generated to build it.  The target name has scope in the directory in which it is created and below.  It may be referenced like any target built within the project.  IMPORTED executables are useful for convenient reference from commands like add_custom_command.  Details about the imported executable are specified by setting properties whose names begin in "IMPORTED_".  The most important such property is IMPORTED_LOCATION (and its per-configuration version IMPORTED_LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;) which specifies the location of the main executable file on disk.  See documentation of the IMPORTED_* properties for more information.

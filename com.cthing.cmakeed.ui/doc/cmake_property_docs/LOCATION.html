    <a name="single_item:LOCATION"><b><code>LOCATION</code></b></a>: Deprecated.  Use LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt; or avoid altogether.<br>
    <p>This property is provided for compatibility with CMake 2.4 and below. It was meant to get the location of an executable target's output file for use in add_custom_command.  In CMake 2.6 and above add_custom_command automatically recognizes a target name in its COMMAND and DEPENDS options and computes the target location.  Therefore this property need not be used.  This property is not defined for IMPORTED targets because they were not available in CMake 2.4 or below anyway.

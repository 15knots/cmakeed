<ul>

    <a name="single_item:LOCATION"><b><code>LOCATION</code></b></a>: Read-only location of a target on disk.<br>
    <p>For an imported target, this read-only property returns the value of the LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt; property for an unspecified configuration &lt;CONFIG&gt; provided by the target.<br><p>For a non-imported target, this property is provided for compatibility with CMake 2.4 and below.  It was meant to get the location of an executable target's output file for use in add_custom_command.  The path may contain a build-system-specific portion that is replaced at build time with the configuration getting built (such as "$(ConfigurationName)" in VS). In CMake 2.6 and above add_custom_command automatically recognizes a target name in its COMMAND and DEPENDS options and computes the target location.  Therefore this property is not needed for creating custom commands.

    <a name="single_item:RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"><b><code>RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</code></b></a>: Output directory in which to build RUNTIME target files.<br>
    <p>This property specifies the directory into which runtime target files should be built. There are three kinds of target files that may be built: archive, library, and runtime.  Executables are always treated as runtime targets. Static libraries are always treated as archive targets. Module libraries are always treated as library targets. For non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library targets. For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is treated as a runtime target and the corresponding import library is treated as an archive target. All Windows-based systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms. This property is initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is created.

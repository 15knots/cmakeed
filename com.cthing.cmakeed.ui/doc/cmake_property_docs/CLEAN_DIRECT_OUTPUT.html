    <p>When a library is built CMake by default generates code to remove any existing library using all possible names.  This is needed to support libraries that switch between STATIC and SHARED by a user option.  However when using OUTPUT_NAME to build a static and shared library of the same name using different logical target names the two targets will remove each other's files.  This can be prevented by setting the CLEAN_DIRECT_OUTPUT property to 1.

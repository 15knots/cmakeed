    <a name="single_item:LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC"><b><code>LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC</code></b></a>: End a link line such that static system libraries are used.<br>
    <p>Some linkers support switches such as -Bstatic and -Bdynamic to determine whether to use static or shared libraries for -lXXX options.  CMake uses these options to set the link type for libraries whose full paths are not known or (in some cases) are in implicit link directories for the platform.  By default the linker search type is left at -Bdynamic by the end of the library list.  This property switches the final linker search type to -Bstatic.

    <a name="single_item:BUILD_SHARED_LIBS"><b><code>BUILD_SHARED_LIBS</code></b></a>: Global flag to cause add_library to create shared libraries if on.<br>
    <p>If present and true, this will cause all libraries to be built shared unless the library was explicitly added as a static library.  This variable is often added to projects as an OPTION so that each user of a project can decide if they want to build the project using shared or static libraries.

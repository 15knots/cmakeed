    <a name="single_item:FindBoost"><b><code>FindBoost</code></b></a>: Try to find Boost include dirs and libraries<br>
    <p>Usage of this module as follows:<br><pre>     SET(Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS ON)<br>     SET(Boost_USE_MULTITHREAD OFF)<br>     FIND_PACKAGE( Boost 1.34.1 COMPONENTS date_time filesystem iostreams ... )<br></pre>
    <p><br><p>The Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS variable can be used to specify a list of boost version numbers that should be taken into account when searching for the libraries. Unfortunately boost puts the version number into the actual filename for the libraries, so this might be needed in the future when new Boost versions are released.<br><p>Currently this module searches for the following version numbers: 1.33, 1.33.0, 1.33.1, 1.34, 1.34.0, 1.34.1, 1.35, 1.35.0, 1.35.1, 1.36,  1.36.0, 1.36.1<br><p>The components list needs to be the actual names of boost libraries, that is the part of the actual library files that differ on different libraries. So its "date_time" for "libboost_date_time...". Anything else will result in errors<br><p>You can provide a minimum version number that should be used. If you provide this  version number and specify the REQUIRED attribute, this module will fail if it can't find the specified or a later version. If you specify a version number this is automatically put into the considered list of version numbers and thus doesn't need to be specified in the Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS variable<br><p>Variables used by this module, they can change the default behaviour and need to be set before calling find_package:<br><pre>  Boost_USE_MULTITHREAD         Can be set to OFF to use the non-multithreaded<br>                                boost libraries. Defaults to ON.<br>  Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS         Can be set to ON to force the use of the static<br>                                boost libraries. Defaults to OFF.<br>  Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS     A list of version numbers to use for searching<br>                                the boost include directory. The default list<br>                                of version numbers is:<br>                                1.33, 1.33.0, 1.33.1, 1.34, 1.34.0, 1.34.1, <br>                                1.35, 1.35.0, 1.35.1, 1.36, 1.36.0, 1.36.1<br>                                If you want to look for an older or newer<br>                                version set this variable to a list of<br>                                strings, where each string contains a number, i.e.<br>                                SET(Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS "0.99.0" "1.35.0")<br>  BOOST_ROOT or BOOSTROOT       Preferred installation prefix for searching for Boost,<br>                                set this if the module has problems finding the proper Boost installation<br>  BOOST_INCLUDEDIR              Set this to the include directory of Boost, if the<br>                                module has problems finding the proper Boost installation<br>  BOOST_LIBRARYDIR              Set this to the lib directory of Boost, if the<br>                                module has problems finding the proper Boost installation<br></pre>

    <a name="single_item:FindQt4"><b><code>FindQt4</code></b></a>: Find QT 4<br>
    <p>This module can be used to find Qt4. The most important issue is that the Qt4 qmake is available via the system path. This qmake is then used to detect basically everything else. This module defines a number of key variables and macros.  First is QT_USE_FILE which is the path to a CMake file that can be included  to compile Qt 4 applications and libraries.  By default, the QtCore and QtGui  libraries are loaded. This behavior can be changed by setting one or more  of the following variables to true before doing INCLUDE(${QT_USE_FILE}):<br><pre>                    QT_DONT_USE_QTCORE<br>                    QT_DONT_USE_QTGUI<br>                    QT_USE_QT3SUPPORT<br>                    QT_USE_QTASSISTANT<br>                    QT_USE_QTDESIGNER<br>                    QT_USE_QTMOTIF<br>                    QT_USE_QTMAIN<br>                    QT_USE_QTNETWORK<br>                    QT_USE_QTNSPLUGIN<br>                    QT_USE_QTOPENGL<br>                    QT_USE_QTSQL<br>                    QT_USE_QTXML<br>                    QT_USE_QTSVG<br>                    QT_USE_QTTEST<br>                    QT_USE_QTUITOOLS<br>                    QT_USE_QTDBUS<br>                    QT_USE_QTSCRIPT<br>                    QT_USE_QTASSISTANTCLIENT<br>                    QT_USE_QTHELP<br>                    QT_USE_QTWEBKIT<br>                    QT_USE_QTXMLPATTERNS<br>                    QT_USE_PHONON<br></pre>
    <p><br><p>The file pointed to by QT_USE_FILE will set up your compile environment by adding include directories, preprocessor defines, and populate a QT_LIBRARIES variable containing all the Qt libraries and their dependencies. Add the QT_LIBRARIES variable to your TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES.<br><p>Typical usage could be something like:<br><pre>   FIND_PACKAGE(Qt4)<br>   SET(QT_USE_QTXML 1)<br>   INCLUDE(${QT_USE_FILE})<br>   ADD_EXECUTABLE(myexe main.cpp)<br>   TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(myexe ${QT_LIBRARIES})<br></pre>
    <p><br><p><br><p>There are also some files that need processing by some Qt tools such as moc and uic.  Listed below are macros that may be used to process those files.<br><pre>  <br>  macro QT4_WRAP_CPP(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS ...)<br>        create moc code from a list of files containing Qt class with<br>        the Q_OBJECT declaration.  Per-direcotry preprocessor definitions <br>        are also added.  Options may be given to moc, such as those found<br>        when executing "moc -help".  <br></pre>
    <p><br><pre>  macro QT4_WRAP_UI(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS ...)<br>        create code from a list of Qt designer ui files.<br>        Options may be given to uic, such as those found<br>        when executing "uic -help"<br></pre>
    <p><br><pre>  macro QT4_ADD_RESOURCES(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS ...)<br>        create code from a list of Qt resource files.<br>        Options may be given to rcc, such as those found<br>        when executing "rcc -help"<br></pre>
    <p><br><pre>  macro QT4_GENERATE_MOC(inputfile outputfile )<br>        creates a rule to run moc on infile and create outfile.<br>        Use this if for some reason QT4_WRAP_CPP() isn't appropriate, e.g.<br>        because you need a custom filename for the moc file or something similar.<br></pre>
    <p><br><pre>  macro QT4_AUTOMOC(sourcefile1 sourcefile2 ... )<br>        This macro is still experimental.<br>        It can be used to have moc automatically handled.<br>        So if you have the files foo.h and foo.cpp, and in foo.h a <br>        a class uses the Q_OBJECT macro, moc has to run on it. If you don't<br>        want to use QT4_WRAP_CPP() (which is reliable and mature), you can insert<br>        #include "foo.moc"<br>        in foo.cpp and then give foo.cpp as argument to QT4_AUTOMOC(). This will the<br>        scan all listed files at cmake-time for such included moc files and if it finds<br>        them cause a rule to be generated to run moc at build time on the <br>        accompanying header file foo.h.<br>        If a source file has the SKIP_AUTOMOC property set it will be ignored by this macro.<br></pre>
    <p><br><pre>  macro QT4_ADD_DBUS_INTERFACE(outfiles interface basename)<br>        create a the interface header and implementation files with the <br>        given basename from the given interface xml file and add it to <br>        the list of sources<br></pre>
    <p><br><pre>  macro QT4_ADD_DBUS_INTERFACES(outfiles inputfile ... )<br>        create the interface header and implementation files <br>        for all listed interface xml files<br>        the name will be automatically determined from the name of the xml file<br></pre>
    <p><br><pre>  macro QT4_ADD_DBUS_ADAPTOR(outfiles xmlfile parentheader parentclassname [basename] )<br>        create a dbus adaptor (header and implementation file) from the xml file<br>        describing the interface, and add it to the list of sources. The adaptor<br>        forwards the calls to a parent class, defined in parentheader and named<br>        parentclassname. The name of the generated files will be<br>        &lt;basename&gt;adaptor.{cpp,h} where basename is the basename of the xml file.<br></pre>
    <p><br><pre>  macro QT4_GENERATE_DBUS_INTERFACE( header [interfacename] )<br>        generate the xml interface file from the given header.<br>        If the optional argument interfacename is omitted, the name of the <br>        interface file is constructed from the basename of the header with<br>        the suffix .xml appended.<br></pre>
    <p><br><pre>  macro QT4_CREATE_TRANSLATION( qm_files directories ... sources ... <br>                                ts_files ... OPTIONS ...)<br>        out: qm_files<br>        in:  directories sources ts_files<br>        options: flags to pass to lupdate, such as -extensions to specify<br>        extensions for a directory scan.<br>        generates commands to create .ts (vie lupdate) and .qm<br>        (via lrelease) - files from directories and/or sources. The ts files are <br>        created and/or updated in the source tree (unless given with full paths).<br>        The qm files are generated in the build tree.<br>        Updating the translations can be done by adding the qm_files<br>        to the source list of your library/executable, so they are<br>        always updated, or by adding a custom target to control when<br>        they get updated/generated.<br></pre>
    <p><br><pre>  macro QT4_ADD_TRANSLATION( qm_files ts_files ... )<br>        out: qm_files<br>        in:  ts_files<br>        generates commands to create .qm from .ts - files. The generated<br>        filenames can be found in qm_files. The ts_files<br>        must exists and are not updated in any way.<br></pre>

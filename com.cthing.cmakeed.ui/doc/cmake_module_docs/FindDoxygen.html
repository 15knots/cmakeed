    <p>Doxygen is a documentation generation tool see <a href="http://www.doxygen.org">http://www.doxygen.org</a> With the OS X GUI version, it likes to be installed to /Applications and it contains the doxygen executable in the bundle. In the versions I've  seen, it is located in Resources, but in general, more often binaries are  located in MacOS. This code sets the following variables:<br><pre>  DOXYGEN_EXECUTABLE     = The path to the doxygen command.<br>  DOXYGEN_DOT_EXECUTABLE = The path to the dot program used by doxygen.<br>  DOXYGEN_DOT_PATH       = The path to dot not including the executable<br>  DOXYGEN = same as DOXYGEN_EXECUTABLE for backwards compatibility<br>  DOT = same as DOXYGEN_DOT_EXECUTABLE for backwards compatibility<br></pre>
    
  </li>
</ul>

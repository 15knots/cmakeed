    <p>By including this file, all files in the CMAKE_INSTALL_DEBUG_LIBRARIES, will be installed with INSTALL_PROGRAMS into /bin for WIN32 and /lib for non-win32. If CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RULES is set to TRUE before including this file, then the INSTALL command is not called.  The use can use  the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS to use a custom install  command and install them into any directory they want. If it is the MSVC compiler, then the microsoft run time libraries will be found add automatically added to the CMAKE_INSTALL_DEBUG_LIBRARIES, and installed.   If CMAKE_INSTALL_DEBUG_LIBRARIES is set and it is the MSVC compiler, then the debug libraries are installed when available. If CMAKE_INSTALL_MFC_LIBRARIES is set then the MFC run time libraries are installed as well as the CRT run time libraries.

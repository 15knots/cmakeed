    <p>Locate gdal This module defines GDAL_LIBRARY GDAL_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to gdal  GDAL_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find the headers<br><p>$GDALDIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$GDAL_DIR used in building gdal.<br><p>Created by Eric Wing. I'm not a gdal user, but OpenSceneGraph uses it  for osgTerrain so I whipped this module together for completeness. I actually don't know the conventions or where files are typically placed in distros. Any real gdal users are encouraged to correct this (but please don't break the OS X framework stuff when doing so which is what usually seems  to happen).

    <a name="single_item:FindTclStub"><b><code>FindTclStub</code></b></a>: TCL_STUB_LIBRARY_DEBUG and TK_STUB_LIBRARY_DEBUG were removed.<br>
    <p>This module finds Tcl stub libraries. It first finds Tcl include files and libraries by calling FindTCL.cmake. How to Use the Tcl Stubs Library:<br><pre>   <a href="http://tcl.activestate.com/doc/howto/stubs.html">http://tcl.activestate.com/doc/howto/stubs.html</a><br></pre>
    <p>Using Stub Libraries:<br><pre>   <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com/0130385603/ch48lev1sec3">http://safari.oreilly.com/0130385603/ch48lev1sec3</a><br></pre>
    <p>This code sets the following variables:<br><pre>  TCL_STUB_LIBRARY       = path to Tcl stub library<br>  TK_STUB_LIBRARY        = path to Tk stub library<br></pre>
    <p><br><p>In an effort to remove some clutter and clear up some issues for people who are not necessarily Tcl/Tk gurus/developpers, some variables were moved or removed. Changes compared to CMake 2.4 are:<br><pre>   =&gt; these libs are not packaged by default with Tcl/Tk distributions. <br>      Even when Tcl/Tk is built from source, several flavors of debug libs<br>      are created and there is no real reason to pick a single one<br>      specifically (say, amongst tclstub84g, tclstub84gs, or tclstub84sgx). <br>      Let's leave that choice to the user by allowing him to assign <br>      TCL_STUB_LIBRARY to any Tcl library, debug or not.<br></pre>

    <p>This is part of the Findosg* suite used to find OpenSceneGraph components. Each component is separate and you must opt in to each module. You must  also opt into OpenGL and OpenThreads (and Producer if needed) as these  modules won't do it for you. This is to allow you control over your own  system piece by piece in case you need to opt out of certain components or change the Find behavior for a particular module (perhaps because the default FindOpenGL.cmake module doesn't work with your system as an example). If you want to use a more convenient module that includes everything, use the FindOpenSceneGraph.cmake instead of the Findosg*.cmake modules.<br><p>Locate osgAnimation This module defines<br><p>OSGANIMATION_FOUND - Was osgAnimation found? OSGANIMATION_INCLUDE_DIR - Where to find the headers OSGANIMATION_LIBRARIES - The libraries to link against for the OSG (use this)<br><p>OSGANIMATION_LIBRARY - The OSG library OSGANIMATION_LIBRARY_DEBUG - The OSG debug library<br><p>$OSGDIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$OSGDIR used in building osg.<br><p>Created by Eric Wing.

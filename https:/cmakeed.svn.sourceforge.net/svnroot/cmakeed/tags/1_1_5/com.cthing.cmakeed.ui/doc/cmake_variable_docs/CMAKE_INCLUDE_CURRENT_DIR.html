    <a name="single_item:CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR"><b><code>CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR</code></b></a>: Automatically add the current source- and build directories to the include path.<br>
    <p>If this variable is enabled, CMake automatically adds in each directory ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR} and ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR} to the include path for this directory. These additional include directories do not propagate down to subdirectories. This is useful mainly for out-of-source builds, where files generated into the build tree are included by files located in the source tree.<br><p>By default CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR is OFF.

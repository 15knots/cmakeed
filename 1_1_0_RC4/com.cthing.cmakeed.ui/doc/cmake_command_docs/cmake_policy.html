    <p>As CMake evolves it is sometimes necessary to change existing behavior in order to fix bugs or improve implementations of existing features.  The CMake Policy mechanism is designed to help keep existing projects building as new versions of CMake introduce changes in behavior.  Each new policy (behavioral change) is given an identifier of the form "CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;" where "&lt;NNNN&gt;" is an integer index.  Documentation associated with each policy describes the OLD and NEW behavior and the reason the policy was introduced.  Projects may set each policy to select the desired behavior.  When CMake needs to know which behavior to use it checks for a setting specified by the project.  If no setting is available the OLD behavior is assumed and a warning is produced requesting that the policy be set.<br><p>The cmake_policy command is used to set policies to OLD or NEW behavior.  While setting policies individually is supported, we encourage projects to set policies based on CMake versions.<br><pre>  cmake_policy(VERSION major.minor[.patch])<br></pre>
    <p>Specify that the current CMake list file is written for the given version of CMake.  All policies introduced in the specified version or earlier will be set to use NEW behavior.  All policies introduced after the specified version will be reset to use OLD behavior with a warning.  This effectively requests behavior preferred as of a given CMake version and tells newer CMake versions to warn about their new policies.  The policy version specified must be at least 2.4 or the command will report an error.  In order to get compatibility features supporting versions earlier than 2.4 see documentation of policy CMP0001.<br><pre>  cmake_policy(SET CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; NEW)<br>  cmake_policy(SET CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; OLD)<br></pre>
    <p>Tell CMake to use the OLD or NEW behavior for a given policy.  Projects depending on the old behavior of a given policy may silence a policy warning by setting the policy state to OLD.  Alternatively one may fix the project to work with the new behavior and set the policy state to NEW.<br><pre>  cmake_policy(GET CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; &lt;variable&gt;)<br></pre>
    <p>Check whether a given policy is set to OLD or NEW behavior.  The output variable value will be "OLD" or "NEW" if the policy is set, and empty otherwise.<br><pre>  cmake_policy(PUSH)<br>  cmake_policy(POP)<br></pre>
    <p>Push and pop the current policy setting state on a stack.  Each PUSH must have a matching POP.  This is useful when mixing multiple projects, subprojects, and files included from external projects that may each have been written for a different version of CMake.  Each subdirectory entered by the project automatically pushes a new level on the stack to isolate the subdirectories from their parents.

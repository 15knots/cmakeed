### Update Site
This composite update site contains the latest release as well as selected older releases: 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/15knots/cmakeed/master/cmakeed-update/ .

Tool integrators will find each release at [bintray](https://bintray.com/15knots/p2-zip/cmakeed#files).
Each release is provided as a standalone zipped p2 repository and can be consumed in a PDE target platform. To add one
of these repositories to your target platform, add a **Software Site** and enter a URL for the location as
`**jar:**https://dl.bintray.com/15knots/p2-zip/CMakeEd-1.8.0.zip**!/**` (note the leading `jar:` and the trailing `!/`).

### Debug and Build
This project uses Apache maven as its build system.
To build from a command-line, run `mvn -f ./parent/pom.xml verify` in the root directory of the project source files.

There is a run configuration for eclipse to invoke maven `build cmakeed` plus a launch configuration to debug the plugin: `CmakeEd`.

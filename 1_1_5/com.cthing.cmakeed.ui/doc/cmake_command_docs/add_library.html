    <a name="single_item:add_library"><b><code>add_library</code></b></a>: Add a library to the project using the specified source files.<br>
    <pre>  add_library(&lt;name&gt; [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE]<br>              [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL]<br>              source1 source2 ... sourceN)<br></pre>
    <p>Adds a library target called &lt;name&gt; to be built from the source files listed in the command invocation.  The &lt;name&gt; corresponds to the logical target name and must be globally unique within a project.  The actual file name of the library built is constructed based on conventions of the native platform (such as lib&lt;name&gt;.a or &lt;name&gt;.lib).<br><p>STATIC, SHARED, or MODULE may be given to specify the type of library to be created.  STATIC libraries are archives of object files for use when linking other targets.  SHARED libraries are linked dynamically and loaded at runtime.  MODULE libraries are plugins that are not linked into other targets but may be loaded dynamically at runtime using dlopen-like functionality.  If no type is given explicitly the type is STATIC or SHARED based on whether the current value of the variable BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is true.<br><p>By default the library file will be created in the build tree directory corresponding to the source tree directory in which the command was invoked.  See documentation of the ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, and RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY target properties to change this location.  See documentation of the OUTPUT_NAME target property to change the &lt;name&gt; part of the final file name.  <br><p>If EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL is given the corresponding property will be set on the created target.  See documentation of the EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL target property for details.<br><p>The add_library command can also create IMPORTED library targets using this signature:<br><pre>  add_library(&lt;name&gt; &lt;SHARED|STATIC|MODULE|UNKNOWN&gt; IMPORTED)<br></pre>
    <p>An IMPORTED library target references a library file located outside the project.  No rules are generated to build it.  The target name has scope in the directory in which it is created and below.  It may be referenced like any target built within the project.  IMPORTED libraries are useful for convenient reference from commands like target_link_libraries.  Details about the imported library are specified by setting properties whose names begin in "IMPORTED_".  The most important such property is IMPORTED_LOCATION (and its per-configuration version IMPORTED_LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;) which specifies the location of the main library file on disk.  See documentation of the IMPORTED_* properties for more information.

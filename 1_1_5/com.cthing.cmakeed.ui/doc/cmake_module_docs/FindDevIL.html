    <p>This module locates the developer's image library. <a href="http://openil.sourceforge.net/">http://openil.sourceforge.net/</a><br><p>This module sets: IL_LIBRARIES the name of the IL library. These include the full path to the core DevIL library. This one has to be linked into the application. ILU_LIBRARIES the name of the ILU library. Again, the full path. This library is for filters and effects, not actual loading. It doesn't have to be linked if the functionality it provides is not used. ILUT_LIBRARIES the name of the ILUT library. Full path. This part of the library interfaces with OpenGL. It is not strictly needed in applications. IL_INCLUDE_DIR where to find the il.h, ilu.h and ilut.h files. IL_FOUND this is set to TRUE if all the above variables were set. This will be set to false if ILU or ILUT are not found, even if they are not needed. In most systems, if one library is found all the others are as well. That's the way the DevIL developers release it.

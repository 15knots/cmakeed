    <a name="single_item:CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH"><b><code>CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH</code></b></a>: Path to be ignored by FIND_XXX() commands.<br />
    <p>Specifies directories to be ignored by searches in FIND_XXX() commands This is useful in cross-compiled environments where some system directories contain incompatible but possibly linkable libraries. For example, on cross-compiled cluster environments, this allows a user to ignore directories containing libraries meant for the front-end machine that modules like FindX11 (and others) would normally search. By default this is empty; it is intended to be set by the project. Note that CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH takes a list of directory names, NOT a list of prefixes. If you want to ignore paths under prefixes (bin, include, lib, etc.), you'll need to specify them explicitly. See also CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH, CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH.</p>

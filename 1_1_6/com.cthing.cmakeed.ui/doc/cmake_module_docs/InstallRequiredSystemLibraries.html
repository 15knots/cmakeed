    <p>By including this file, all library files listed in the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS will be installed with INSTALL(PROGRAMS ...) into bin for WIN32 and lib for non-WIN32. If CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS_SKIP is set to TRUE before including this file, then the INSTALL command is not called. The user can use the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS to use a custom install command and install them however they want. If it is the MSVC compiler, then the microsoft run time libraries will be found and automatically added to the CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS, and installed. If CMAKE_INSTALL_DEBUG_LIBRARIES is set and it is the MSVC compiler, then the debug libraries are installed when available. If CMAKE_INSTALL_DEBUG_LIBRARIES_ONLY is set then only the debug libraries are installed when both debug and release are available. If CMAKE_INSTALL_MFC_LIBRARIES is set then the MFC run time libraries are installed as well as the CRT run time libraries. If CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_DESTINATION is set then the libraries are installed to that directory rather than the default. If CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS_NO_WARNINGS is NOT set, then this file warns about required files that do not exist. You can set this variable to ON before including this file to avoid the warning. For example, the Visual Studio Express editions do not include the redistributable files, so if you include this file on a machine with only VS Express installed, you'll get the warning.</p>

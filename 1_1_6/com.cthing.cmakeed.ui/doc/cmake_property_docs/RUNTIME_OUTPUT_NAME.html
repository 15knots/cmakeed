    <a name="single_item:RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME"><b><code>RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME</code></b></a>: Output name for RUNTIME target files.<br />
    <p>This property specifies the base name for runtime target files.  It overrides OUTPUT_NAME and OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; properties.  There are three kinds of target files that may be built: archive, library, and runtime.  Executables are always treated as runtime targets. Static libraries are always treated as archive targets. Module libraries are always treated as library targets. For non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library targets. For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is treated as a runtime target and the corresponding import library is treated as an archive target. All Windows-based systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms.</p>

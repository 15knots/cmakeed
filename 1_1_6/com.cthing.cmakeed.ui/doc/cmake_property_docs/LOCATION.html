<ul>
  <li>
    <a name="single_item:LOCATION"><b><code>LOCATION</code></b></a>: Read-only location of a target on disk.<br />
    <p>For an imported target, this read-only property returns the value of the LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt; property for an unspecified configuration &lt;CONFIG&gt; provided by the target.<br /></p>
<p>For a non-imported target, this property is provided for compatibility with CMake 2.4 and below.  It was meant to get the location of an executable target's output file for use in add_custom_command.  The path may contain a build-system-specific portion that is replaced at build time with the configuration getting built (such as "$(ConfigurationName)" in VS). In CMake 2.6 and above add_custom_command automatically recognizes a target name in its COMMAND and DEPENDS options and computes the target location.  In CMake 2.8.4 and above add_custom_command recognizes generator expressions to refer to target locations anywhere in the command.  Therefore this property is not needed for creating custom commands.<br /></p>
<p>Do not set properties that affect the location of the target after reading this property.  These include properties whose names match "(RUNTIME|LIBRARY|ARCHIVE)_OUTPUT_(NAME|DIRECTORY)(_&lt;CONFIG&gt;)?" or "(IMPLIB_)?(PREFIX|SUFFIX)".  Failure to follow this rule is not diagnosed and leaves the location of the target undefined.</p>

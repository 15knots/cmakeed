    <pre>  include_directories([AFTER|BEFORE] [SYSTEM] dir1 dir2 ...)<br /></pre>
    <p>Add the given directories to those searched by the compiler for include files. By default the directories are appended onto the current list of directories. This default behavior can be changed by setting CMAKE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES_BEFORE to ON. By using BEFORE or AFTER you can select between appending and prepending, independent from the default. If the SYSTEM option is given the compiler will be told that the directories are meant as system include directories on some platforms.</p>
